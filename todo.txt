# Validations
-- Should validations be entirely on the models, with a layer on top of that 
-- to return the correct HTTP code and error messages with the response?
   * NB Mongoose validations are pretty shitty. Also, tying validations to 
        the database/adapter is not composable. Better to validate on model 
        then the schema--stick validations on models/.., (but models shouldn't
        be aware of HTTP codes... let routes/.. callbacks handle that).
*  Validate that ObjectIds passed in refer to a real, org-owned object
*  Validate times (sendTime, recievedTime, etc) (use moment.js?)
*  Validate allowed frequencies? Is this something the API should facilitate?
